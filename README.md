# Profane Words Collection

This repository contains a curated JSON file with collections of profane words in English. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive and accessible resource for developers who need to filter or flag inappropriate language in their applications, projects, or systems. 

## Why this project?

Detecting and managing inappropriate language is a common requirement for chat systems, content moderation tools, and educational applications. However, existing resources are often incomplete or outdated. This repository aims to address that gap by creating a community-driven and ever-growing list of profane words. 

**Note:** The list is intended solely for educational and technical purposes. It is not meant to offend or target anyone.

## File Format

The profane words are stored in a simple JSON file, formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "words": [
    "example1",
    "example2",
    "example3"
  ]
}
```

## Contributing

We warmly welcome contributions to this project! If you know of any profane words or phrases that are missing, please contribute by following these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add the missing words to the `words` array in the JSON file.
3. Submit a pull request with your changes.

### Guidelines for Contributions

- Only add words or phrases that are widely recognized as profane in English.
- Avoid duplicating existing entries.
- Ensure the JSON file remains valid and properly formatted.
- If you have suggestions for organizing the list (e.g., categories), feel free to open an issue to discuss them.
